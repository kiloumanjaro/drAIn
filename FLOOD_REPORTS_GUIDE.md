# Flood Reports Page Guide

This document provides a guide on the purpose and usage of the flood reports page.

## Overview

The flood reports page is designed to display a comprehensive, multi-year report on flood loss events in Mandaue City. The primary goal is to provide a dynamic, maintainable, and web-native component that can be easily updated and scaled in the future.

## Goal

The main goal of this feature is to translate the static PDF document into a dynamic and interactive web page. This allows for easier access to the data and provides a foundation for future features such as filtering and sorting.

## How to Use

Currently, the flood reports page is not linked to any button in the UI. To access it, you can navigate directly to the `/reports` route in your browser.

For example, if you are running the application locally, you can access the page by visiting:

`http://localhost:3000/reports`

This will render the page with the historical flood data from the `data/mandaue_flood_reports.json` file.

## Future Integration

This page can be easily integrated into the main application by adding a link or button that navigates to the `/reports` route. For example, you could add a link to the main navigation bar or a button on the dashboard.
